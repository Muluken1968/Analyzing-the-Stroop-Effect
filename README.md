# Analyzing the Stroop Effect:

In this project, we will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [**Stroop Effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect). We will look at some data collected from others who have performed the experiment and we will compute some statistics describing the results.
