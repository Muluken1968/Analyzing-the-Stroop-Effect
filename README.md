# Analyzing the Stroop Effect using t-test: [*here to preview*](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/anoru/Analyzing-the-Stroop-Effect/blob/master/StroopEffect.html)

In this project, we will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [**Stroop Effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect). We will look at some data collected from others who have performed the experiment and we will compute some statistics describing the results.

## Why this Project?
Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allows us to investigate data and make inferences based on our observations. A foundation in statistics also allows us to be a consumer of analyses that others perform, and allows us to relate to the conclusions others have drawn from their investigations.

## What you will Learn?
This project will review the basic concepts of statistics, including:

- How to identify components of an experiment
- How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
- How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results

## Questions For Investigation

1. What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?
2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.
3. Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset. Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability.
4. Provide one or two visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data. Write one or two sentences noting what you observe about the plot or plots.
5. Now, perform the statistical test and report your results. What is your confidence level and your critical statistic value? Do you reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it? Come to a conclusion in terms of the experiment task. Did the results match up with your expectations?
6. Optional: What do you think is responsible for the effects observed? Can you think of an alternative or similar task that would result in a similar effect? Some research about the problem will be helpful for thinking about these two questions!
